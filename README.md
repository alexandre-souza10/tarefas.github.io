## Project Description:
- In this project, a task list page was developed, simple and functional, fulfilling the intended purpose,
a Front-End Project, using HTML, CSS, Java Script and React.js. It consists of clicking on the + button, and it will trigger a modal, where you can describe your task,
and save it, where it will be registered in my tasks, having the option to delete it in the x in front of the task.

- The Project has the functionality of showing a dynamic interface of a simple and objective list of tasks, in order to be able to place any type of task, we insert the task in the modal,
and when saving it, it will be registered in my tasks in the form of a list, having the option to delete it, or simply leave it saved,
so you can remember your day-to-day tasks dynamically.

- Next we have a small instructional video, where we show an example of how the Dynamic Task List page works.
